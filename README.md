# This is the final version of my project.  There are three files needed for the full project: Devices.py, SetStatesIAPWS.py, and cycle.py.  Any code should be run in cycles so it can access all the modules (or import them in a new file).  Files marked wih notUsed are files I was developing before I switched over to IAPWS.  They are no longer used, but I didn't want to remove them.
